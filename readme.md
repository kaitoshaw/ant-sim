It will give you the visualisation of how the ants work gather the food back to their base based on their intelligence Level


## Intelligence Levels

The intelligence level of the ants are differentiated into three levels: 0, 1, and 2. 

- Intelligence 0 means that the ants have no Pheromone skill and Chemosense to help them gathering the food
- Intelligence 1 means that the ants have Chemosense to sense nearby food and have the idea of the food location. However, they are not sharing the food location information to the ants within the same colony
- Intelligence 2 means that the ants have both Pheromone, a skill to leave trails to make other ants know where to get the food, and the Chemosense to sense the nearby food.
